## ♟️ Develop strategy

At the beginning I would like to create a backend using nest microservices communicating with RabbitMQ. Then I would like to create a frontend with nuxt and vue, the next step will be to create a mobile application in NativeScript. Finally, I would like to release a desktop application for every operating system.
